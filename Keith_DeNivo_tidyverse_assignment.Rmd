## TidyVerse Vignette

Your task here is to Create an Example. Using one or more TidyVerse
packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a
programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more
of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected
dataset. (25 points) Later, you'll be asked to extend an existing
vignette. Using one of your classmate’s examples (as created above),
you'll then extend his or her example with additional annotated code.
(15 points) You should clone the provided repository. Once you have code
to submit, you should make a pull request on the shared repository. You
should also update the README.md file with your example. After you’ve
created your vignette, please submit your GitHub handle name in the
submission link provided below. This will let your instructor know that
your work is ready to be peer-graded. You should complete your
submission on the schedule stated in the course syllabus.

## FORCATS VIGNETTE

## forcats

Resources: <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors.html>
<https://forcats.tidyverse.org/>

forcats is most useful when dealing with factors.

"Factors are used for categorical variables, variables that have a fixed
and known set of possible values. They are also useful when you want to
display character vectors in a non-alphabetical order." -
<https://r4ds.hadley.nz/factors.html>

forcats is most useful when dealing with factors. Factors are character
vectors such as eye color. It works best when there are limited number
of character vectors such as eye colors "brown", "blue", "green" etc.

In this car data set there are a couple of columns with character
vectors. We will be looking at the "owner" column in the dataset. It
displays the number of owners a car has, but using characters instead of
numerically.

Data source:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/car-price-prediction-dataset/data>

Some forcats functions: " fct_reorder(): Reordering a factor by another
variable. fct_infreq(): Reordering a factor by the frequency of values.
fct_relevel(): Changing the order of a factor by hand. fct_lump():
Collapsing the least/most frequent values of a factor into “other”. " -
<https://forcats.tidyverse.org/>

We will take a look at `fct_reorder()` and `fct_infreq()`.

```{r read in data}

car_url <-
  getURL(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/main/cardekho.csv"
  )
car_df <- data.frame(read.csv(text = car_url))
head(car_df)
names(car_df)

```

## Data

Data set uploaded to the tidyverse git. Data is read into a data frame.
The data contains car names, the number of owners the car has had,
years, etc.

```{r owners}
# What are the types of owners?
unique(car_df$owner)
car_df |> count(owner)


owner_levels <- c("Test Drive Car",
                  "First Owner",
                  "Second Owner",
                  "Third Owner",
                  "Fourth & Above Owner")
#setting the order the owners will appear.
```

## Factors

One thing useful about factors is it allows one to set any order of the
character vectors, not just in alphabetical order. Using levels we are
about to designate the number of owners in ascending order.

```{r factors}

num_owners <- car_df$owner
o1 <- factor(num_owners, levels = owner_levels)
sort(o1[1:100])
# the values in a column can be sorted by the levels what about the entire dataframe?

car_df <- car_df %>%
  arrange(factor(owner, levels = owner_levels))
#the dataframe can now be listed by the number of owners.

knitr::kable(car_df[1:20, 1:8], format = "html")
```

## Reorder

Reordering data frames by factors with user defined levels can be
useful, but what about graphs?

```{r graphs }
#another package is ggplot2 for graphs
ggplot(car_df, aes(x = selling_price, y = owner)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# not ordered
ggplot(car_df, aes(x = selling_price, y = fct_reorder(owner, selling_price))) +
  geom_boxplot()
#ordered by selling price for the factors.
```

## Sorting/Arranging

The factors can be reordered by the which ones had the highest values.

```{r example what forcats is not for}

ggplot(car_df, aes(x = year, y = selling_price, group = year)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# the sorting with forcats only works with factors and can not be used to order numerical values, there are many other tools to easily sort by numerical value.

```

```{r by frequency of factor}
car_df |> 
mutate(owner = fct_infreq(owner)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = owner)) + 
  ggtitle("how many cars on for each number of owners?")+
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_flip()
#how many of each owner type?
#sort by the frequency of a owner

```

## Adding/Dropping

Additionally, we can drop factors with the `fct_drop()` function, which
drops unused levels. First, we drop the test drive observations from the
data, and verify that even though this level is no longer used, the
factor variable categorizing the number of owners of a car still shows
"Test Drive Car" as a valid potential level of the factor. By using
`fct_drop()` below, we drop this unused level from the factor.

```{r dropping factors}

# Filtering test cars out of our data so that it becomes an "unused" level
num_owners_nontest <- car_df$owner[car_df$owner != "Test Drive Car"]

# Assigning new factor `o2` based on the number of owners in the filtered dataset. There are still 5 levels of this factor, despite there being observations for only 4 of these levels in the data.
o2 <- factor(num_owners_nontest, levels = owner_levels)
levels(o2)

# Using fct_drop() to remove unused "Test Drive Car" level
o2 <- fct_drop(o2)

# Display the levels of the modified factor
levels(o2)
```

Thus, the `o2` factor was created with only 4 levels as displayed above,
without the level for "Test Drive Car."

We can also add a level to a factor with the function `fct_expand`. I
created the level "Non-owner" to add to the factor `o2` created in the
previous chunk:

```{r adding factors}
o3 <- fct_expand(o2, "Non-owner")
levels(o3)
```

## Conclusion

The function `fct_infreq()` can be used to sort by the frequency of the
factor. The numerical values for the y values of factors can be
reordered using `fct_reorder()`. `fct_reorder()` and `fact_infreq()`
were used to reorder data frames and graphs.

To extend this assignment, we also explored how to add and drop levels
to/from factors with `fct_drop()` and `fct_expand().`
